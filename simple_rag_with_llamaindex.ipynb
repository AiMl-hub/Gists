        "# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying PDF document(s). The system uses a pipeline that encodes the documents and creates nodes. These nodes then can be used to build a vector index to retrieve relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PDF processing and text extraction\n",
        "2. Text chunking for manageable processing\n",
        "3. Ingestion pipeline creation using FAISS as vector store and OpenAI embeddings\n",
        "4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n",
        "5. Evaluation of the RAG system\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "### Document Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The PDF is loaded using [SimpleDirectoryReader](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/simpledirectoryreader/).\n",
        "2. The text is split into [nodes/chunks](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/documents_and_nodes/) using [SentenceSplitter](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/#sentencesplitter) with specified chunk size and overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Text Cleaning\n",
        "\n",
        "A custom transformation `TextCleaner` is applied to clean the texts. This likely addresses specific formatting issues in the PDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ingestion Pipeline Creation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text nodes.\n",
        "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retriever Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modular Design: The ingestion process is encapsulated in a single function for easy reuse.\n",
        "2. Configurable Chunking: Allows adjustment of chunk size and overlap.\n",
        "3. Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search.\n",
        "4. Evaluation: Includes a function to evaluate the RAG system's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Example\n",
        "\n",
        "The code includes a test query: \"What is the main cause of climate change?\". This demonstrates how to use the retriever to fetch relevant context from the processed document.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "The system includes an `evaluate_rag` function to assess the performance of the retriever, though the specific metrics used are not detailed in the provided code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.\n",
        "2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.\n",
        "3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within large documents or document collections."

The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change. \\nHistorical Context \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization.', \"Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes. \\nModern Observations \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.\"]\n",
